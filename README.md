## k3s-test-cluster

This is a TEST/DEV CLUSTER running on two Raspberry Pi 4s as that was the only amount of hardware I had free for it.

### :open_file_folder:&nbsp; Repository structure

The Git repository contains the following directories under `cluster` and are ordered below by how Flux will apply them.

- **flux** directory is the entrypoint to Flux
- **bootstrap** directory contains a simple Kustomize resource to deploy Flux to an empty cluster
- **apps** directory is where my common applications (grouped by namespace) are placed.

â”œâ”€â”€ bootstrap
â””â”€â”€ flux
```

Kubernetes nodes are on their own VLAN.
